# E2E Testing with Playwright
# ==============================================================================
# This workflow runs Playwright E2E tests at different levels:
#   - Smoke tests: Fast sanity checks on every PR/push
#   - Critical paths: Core user flows on PRs
#   - Full suite: All E2E tests on main/develop merges
#
# Tests run in parallel for faster feedback.
