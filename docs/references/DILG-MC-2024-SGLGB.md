**SUBJECT:** 2024 SEAL OF GOOD LOCAL GOVERNANCE FOR BARANGAY

**DATE:** *(as issued)*

---

## 1. Background

The Seal of Good Local Governance for Barangay (SGLGB) is a performance assessment and recognition system designed to distinguish barangays with outstanding performance across various governance areas. It also intends to encourage barangays to continuously progress in delivering efficient, equitable and quality public services. It puts primacy to integrity and good performance as pillars of meaningful local autonomy and development.

Fulfilling the Department's mandate to oversee capacity development initiatives for local government units, and facilitate the institutionalization of performance standards in local governance, the National Barangay Operations Office (NBOO) has implemented the SGLGB program in 2023. The assessment covered 39,623 (94.25%) barangays, with 1,028 (2.59%) achieving National Passers status.

In 2024, the SGLGB Program shall still employ the established "3+1" assessment framework across all 41,996¹ barangays. This initiative strives for sustained improvement in governance practices, ultimately empowering local communities through recognition and fostering developmental initiatives.

## 4. Policy Content/Guidelines

### 4.1. Assessment Criteria

For the CY 2024 SGLGB, the principle **"3+1"** applies, where a barangay needs to **pass ALL of the three (3) Core Governance Areas, AND at least ONE (1) of the Essential Governance Areas.**

#### CORE GOVERNANCE AREAS

These are the foundational indicators that ensure good governance particularly in delivering essential public services. They assess the effectiveness of key programs and projects in terms of financial accountability, peace and order, and protection of life and property.

1. **Financial Administration and Sustainability** – This pertains to a barangay's outstanding practice of accountability and transparency in financial administration by adhering with accounting and auditing standards.

2. **Disaster Preparedness** – This refers to a barangay's proactive measures, including the development and implementation of disaster risk reduction and management programs.

3. **Safety, Peace and Order** – This represents a barangay's outstanding performance in maintaining peace and order through activities and support mechanisms that protect constituents from threats to life, health, and security.

#### ESSENTIAL GOVERNANCE AREAS

These indicators encompass providing basic social welfare services, promoting business and income-generating activities, and safeguarding the environment.

1. **Social Protection and Sensitivity** – This encompasses a barangay's responsiveness to the needs of disadvantaged/challenged sectors and the provision of support for basic education, access to social welfare services, and participation in local special bodies.

2. **Business-Friendliness and Competitiveness** – This reflects a barangay's notable efforts in promoting business and employment through supportive systems, structures, and legislation.

3. **Environmental Management** – This refers to a barangay's conscientious preservation of the environment by complying with the provisions of the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000.

#### 4.1.1. Adjectival Rating of Functionality for Barangay-Based Institutions (BBIs)

Since 2023, SGLGB has adopted the ON-line Expansive and Unified Audit (ONE AUDIT), incorporating the various Barangay-Based Institutions (BBIs) Functionality Audits. This approach signifies an integrated and comprehensive audit process. These includes the audits for the following BBIs:

- Barangay Development Council (BDC)
- Barangay Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Committee (BDRRMC)
- Barangay Peace and Order Committee (BPOC)
- Barangay Ecological Solid Waste Management Committee (BESWMC)
- Violence against Women (VAW) DESK
- Barangay Council for the Protection of Children (BCPC)
- Barangay Anti-Drug Abuse Council (BADAC) *(integrated for CY 2024)*

For uniformity, the BBIs will be rated based on the following compliance rate and adjectival rating:

| Compliance Rate | Adjectival Rating |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| 75% – 100% | Highly Functional |
| 50% – 74% | Moderately Functional |
| 49% – below | Low Functional |

### 4.2 Assessment Forms and Tools
